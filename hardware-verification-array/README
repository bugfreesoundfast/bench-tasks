## Word-Level Hardware-Model-Checking Benchmarks with Bit-Vectors

These programs were produced by [Btor2C](sosy-lab/software/btor2c@bfcfb8b), a word-level-circuit-to-C converter, from word-level hardware-model-checking tasks described in the Btor2 format.

The original hardware tasks only consist of bit-vector types.

Each converted C program contains a URL to its source and is under the same license as its original Btor2 file.

The benchmark set was prepared by Po-Chun Chien and Nian-Ze Lee from SoSy-Lab, LMU Munich.
